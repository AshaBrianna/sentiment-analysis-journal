						As your personal sentiment analysis journal, I'm here to help you. I'm not human. I can't judge you, but I can help!
						On the page on the right, you'll see a graph displaying an analysis of the sentiments you've expressed in your
						entries.
					</p>
					<p>
						Understanding how your emotions fluxuate over time, can help you improve your mental health. Observe how your
						emotions range over time. Look at your highs, lows, and median values. Life's a rollercoaster; we all have ups and
						downs, twists and turns, and high points and low points. Are there any trends you observe?
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to enable me to best assist you, try to journal once a day. The more entries I have to analyze the better!
						More entries means you'll be provided with more relevant resources. Now, stop reading this, and start journaling
