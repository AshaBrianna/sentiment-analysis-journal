					<p>
						Take a moment to reflect on your day. Feel free to let your thoughts drift to review your week,
						month, or even year. Feeling extra philosophical? Contemplate life! Don't set limitations on
						your or attempt to constrain your emotions. Just let them flow onto the page.
					</p>
					<p>
						Understandably, some people feel uncomfortable putting their personal thoughts and experiences
						into words. As your personal
						sentiment analysis journal, I'm here to help you. I'm not human. I can't judge you, but I can
						help!
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to enable me to best assist you, try to journal once a day. The more entries I have to
						analyze the better! More entries means you'll be provided with more relevant
						resources. Now, stop reading this, and start journaling!
